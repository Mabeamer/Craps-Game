The first thing I want to do is create a set of ints that track wins losses and point
	-int wins
	-int losses
	-int point
	-int roundCounter
And a boolean that checks to see if the first roll is correct and moves on to subsequent roll
	-boolean sRolls (subsequent rolls)
Then add an array that holds the messages
	-ArrayList msg

In our main program loop it will run of 2 nested loops the first and it will keep track of how many overall rounds has happened by moving roundCounter up by 1
	roundCounter++
The first loop is the round start
	-int die1/2
	-a way to send whats currently happening into our msg ArrayList for pringing later
	-if statement that checks win condition
	-else if statement that checks lose condition
	-else statement that moves on to our second loop if one of the two are not met with boolean statement
	-both if statements add to the arraylist about the current condition
The second loop is our subsequent rolls
	-running off the boolean sRolls var
	-recreating both die1/die2
	-if statement that checks the die and compare with the point/7
	-win/lose conditions are both created off of that
outside of our first two loops we have one more for loop that prints out the messages it collected 10 times
print out the total wins and total losses
